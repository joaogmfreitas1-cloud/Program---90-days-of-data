Hi guys! Happy New Year!

My goals for next year, 2026, are to become a Data Analyst and then, in the future, with more knowledge and experience, become an Engineer.

I have a study plan that lasts 90 days.
It starts with basic topics, like Excel and some simple SQL queries, and then finishes with applying for a junior position in the area.

These first files are:
• Queries that I created
• A Health Diseases database in Excel

Thanks!
